# Seminar on Visualization with Many-Core
CIS 507, Spring 2017, University of Oregon

This repository contains materials used in the Spring 2017 Seminar on Visualization with Many-Core by Professor Hank Childs. In this seminar, we explored different ways visualization is done on high-performance parallel machines. We specifically explore the VTKm project, an extension for VTK based around C++ Templates for enabling parallel computation on GPUs and multi-core CPUs.

## Contents

* ./examples - Examples of VTKm projects
* ./notes - Notes taken during the seminar
* ./presentation - In-class presentation given on measuring performance in a many-core system using the TAU performance system.
* ./project - Visualization project developed as part of the seminar, implementing a Sobel Filter in VTKm.
* ./README.md - This file

## Built With
* [VTKm](http://m.vtk.org/index.php/Main_Page) - C++ template-based visualization library used to develop multi-core visulaiztion algorithms.

DPP - Data Parallel Primitives
  small sets of functions that operate ididvidaul elements of an array
  ex, map, parallel for, for each, etc..

3 catagories 

  - Data Generation
    - Fill: generate large array, fill each spot with value
    - Sequence: same as fill, but add value based on function of index

  - Data Operation
    - Map: runs a function on each value
       similar to sequence, but instead of running a function on index, runs
       on value
    - Stencil: Function input are nearby values

    - Aggregate:
      - need binary associator operation
      - (x + y) + z === x + (y + z)
      - also called reduce, fold
      -
    - Scan:
      - aggregate but only in certian range
      - prefix sum 

    - Upper bound/ Lower bound:
      - 2 arrays, find highest/lowest place x from A can go in B while 
        preserving B's sorting

  - Data Movement
    - Gather: You have one array with data, one with indexes, gather 
      data from those indexes

    - Scatter: ???

    - Compact: 

What are the implementations of DPP? 
What advantages does DPP have over using some other cross-platform
  parallel programming model like OpenMP/OpenACC/MPI?

ArrayHandle - 
  Basically a wrapper that automatically makes array availible on device

Device Adaptor
  built in "functions" specific to each device
  implementations of the DPPs?

Worklets
  kind of like device kernels
  
  two types: field maps, toplogy maps

  each worklet type has an associated dispatcher type.

  ??? I would make a worklet if i needed to do something not possible using
  only the DPP
  ??? worklet is compiled for specific target device?

"Space filling curves"
in 3D space, cells close "geographically" are closer in the dataset
  things that are spatially nearby have similar indicies
morton curve




----- Papers that explore using Altera OpenCL for graphics algorithms

  FPGA-Specific Optimizations
     Sliding Window Transformation
       More efficient to use 1D kernel with sliding window
       than ND-Range for certian types of problems
     Kernel Pipelining
       Altera intruduces a "channels" construct to move data between kernels
       without transfering back to the host device
       (Figure 3)
     Dynamic Memory-Transfer Alignment
       Altera FPGA OpenCL runtime uses DMA (Direct Memory Access),
         so allocations should be done using _aligned_malloc() in Windows
         and posix_memalign() in linux
